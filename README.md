A Web Server
============

This was a joke to be able to say my website ran on `aws`.

Don't sue me.

Also, don't use this. Use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) instead,
unless you fit the very specific requirements met by this.

It's overly "secure" and will only really work on static sites.

For more information check the man page.
